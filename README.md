# BannedBooks
Creating a dataframe from an excel sheet of banned books and organizing the data.
In this code I used pandas a python data analysis library as well as the built in tools matplotlib and plotly. 

In the main I created the dataframe and allowed for all the rows to be displayed.

In the first Section I created a list of the most frequent authors in the excel and how often (percentage) those authors would show up. 

In the second section I was able to create a linear scatter plot displaying the type of ban going by year and month. 

In the third section I was able to single out the three most unique titles using the built in .unique function.
